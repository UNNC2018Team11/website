## Proposed Architecture

```
start
 |
 V          front end
+--------------------+
|                    | python shell             back end
|  electron          +-------------> +------------------+
|                    | sub process   | virtualenv       |
| (browser)          |               | python server    |
|                    |               |                  |
| (all html/css/js)  |               | (business logic) |
|                    |   thrift      |                  |
| (node.js runtime,  | <-----------> | (thrift server)  |
|  thrift client)    | communication |                  |
|                    |               |                  |
+--------------------+               +------------------+
```

1. Electron as the “launcher and minimal web browser”, loading the web pages dynamically generated by Python, where behind the web pages Python does all the heavy lifting.
2. Electron as the “launcher and minimal web browser”, loading the web pages statically written (the static files `index.html`, etc), where these pages communicate with Python by restful api or something like zeromq.
3. we could use PyInstaller to package the Python files, then use the built-in method of Electron to package all the HTML, CSS, Javascript files and Python binaries together. In the end we are able to distribute the generated binary files. Although we should notice that it may be easy to extract the souce codes in the distributed files.
