Eye-tracking can be described as a process of locating the position of pupils, obtaining the pupil center coordinates, and using some method to calculate the person’s gaze point so that the computer knows what you are looking at. This technology can be used as a useful tool in our daily life because it only needs a camera on your devices. 

We have come up with two applications of eye-tracking technology.

1. **Game**

   Nowadays, most of the games allowed players to use their hands or some motion controllers. In this way, muscles would be sore if people spend too much time on playing games. However, people would not feel tired if they only move their eyes. Thus, it can be a new idea to make a game controlled by player’s eyes, and this game may help players to relax their body during the game.

2. **HCI**

   As we known that the most common and traditional way of human-computer interaction is input through keyboard and mouse, and output through screen. Besides, there are also some methods such as voice interaction and gesture interaction to input user’s request. For the computer, it just needs to receive and understand a command, then they will finish the task. So, eye movement can also be a kind of command to tell computers what they should do. For example, when user is reading an article, the cursor would move to the line which user is looking at according to the analysis of eye movement. Moreover, if user want to open a specific software, he/she can just look at this software without using hands.
